Dubai Islamic Bank Group clearly recognises the importance of maintaining strong governance and will stay committed to ensure that customers, business partners and investors enjoy the utmost confidence in the new combined operation.
The integration of the two operations will further cement DIB’s position as one of the largest and most influential Islamic financial institutions globally, with a long-established track record of financial success, a clearly defined strategy and a robust balance sheet. The new size and scale will allow this powerful group to provide opportunities for economic growth and prosperity across the region, ensuring that the UAE’s financial sector remains at the forefront of the Islamic economy.
On a global scale, DIB will expedite its expansion strategy to connect the dots from the Far East, the sub-continent and East Africa with Dubai as the hub with new markets and locations opening up for one of the most powerful Islamic banks in the world.
