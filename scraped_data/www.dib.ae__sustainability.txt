CO2 Reduced
DIB plants one tree for every new customer, helping offset CO2 emissions through the growth & nurturing of trees.
Our Inspiration
DIB stands as a beacon of responsible finance driven by the deep conviction that the future we desire,
    relies on us taking decisive action now.
We aim to be the financial enablers of a greener tomorrow, by investing in sustainable projects that pave
    the way to an ecologically harmonious future.
The reality of climate change is undeniable and we will not simply bank on a green future, we will create
    one today.
Our Stance
DIB recognises that responsible banking is integral to creating a sustainable world.
Our approach is unwavering and clear: to own the ESG space and finance a sustainable future for all.
We are not just merely waiting for change, we are igniting it!
Dr. Adnan Chilwan
Group CEO
Sustainability is visceral to DIB. It is not merely a management mantra, but an ethos that governs all
                our thoughts and actions as we progress on our journey towards creating a more sustainable tomorrow. Our
                journey of sustainability engages our customers, as we financially enable individuals and businesses,
                our operations, as we empower our employees and stakeholders with value-driven ethical behaviour, our
                partners, as we help them create more socially conscious businesses and, our society, as we champion
                sustainable development for a better future.

Community Care
Our ongoing investments in quality education, affordable housing and healthcare
                                        underscore our resolve to nurture the very roots that sustain our collective
                                        growth..
Diversity & Inclusion
We celebrate the fusion of people of varied backgrounds, and experiences knowing
                                        that true progress is born from the inclusion of all. From championing
                                        Emiratisation, utilising the unique strengths of People Of Determination and
                                        embracing women in the workforce, every individual shapes our narrative of
                                        success.
Be Positive
Being net zero is the mandate; being net positive is our mission.
    Our strides go above and beyond the call of duty, rewriting our
    sustainability narrative one eco-conscious project at a time.

                                        world a better place for all.
Initiatives
We sow the seeds of sustainability that will be reaped by future generations
                                        through transformative initiatives like 'Dubai Can', and 'One Tree For
                                        Everyone'.
The Bigger Picture
Embracing a vision that transcends borders, we proudly align our business
                                        practices with the UAE's forward-looking sustainability goals and the broader
                                        canvas painted by UN's Sustainable Development Goals.
