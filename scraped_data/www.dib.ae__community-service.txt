COMMUNITY SERVICES
While some perceive leadership as a matter of pride or a status symbol, Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB) accepts this as a responsibility - a responsibility as the first name in Islamic banking, a responsibility to customers, a responsibility to shareholders
,
a responsibility to the nation, a responsibility to society, and a responsibility to create a better world through all that we do. DIB is truly The Bank that Cares.
Since giving back to society is an intrinsic part of Islam, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is considered an essential part of the Bank’s philosophy and principles. The Bank takes pride in the fact that its initiatives have been translated into a trend resulting in huge flow of funds into community development. Commitment towards the community distinguishes it from other companies and DIB has rightly earned the reputation of being an organization that is dedicated to making a difference in people’s lives.
As a leading financial institution working for the development of society at large, DIB is a unique organization where the best of business and charity practices come together to contribute to a solid economy and sound society.
Guided by its philosophy of responsible corporate leadership, DIB's commitment to society includes a number of sponsorship programmes, upliftment initiatives and events that have translated into making a difference in society.
Substantiation of this drive is the fact that DIB has won emeafinance’s award for Corporate Social Responsibility in the Middle East for 2009.
Although DIB does not sponsor institutions directly, the Bank strives to lend a helping hand. For instance, DIB has helped innumerable schools to acquire computers and other equipment. The Bank also provided 100% finance for the construction and furnishing of the new Bader School in conjunction with its counterparts from the Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA). The Bank is also continuously helping the physically challenged through financial assistance and practical support such as providing wheelchairs, hearing aids etc.
