His Excellency Mohammed Ibrahim Al Shaibani, Director-General of His Highness The Ruler’s Court of Dubai and Chairman of Dubai Islamic Bank
The UAE continues its robust progress towards economic growth & development despite global uncertainties and regional conflicts. With inflation now showing signs of moderation, central banks have now embarked on lowering rates generating more favorable financial market and economic conditions. UAE’s growth projections remain amongst the strongest in the region driven by rising population, growing tourism and enhanced trading volumes.
Accordingly, DIB’s nine-month performance has been remarkable with total income of nearly AED 17 billion, a robust 17% YoY rise. The bank continues to secure strong new origination from our growing customer base across the country and the region at large.
Dr. Adnan Chilwan, Group Chief Executive Officer

The UAE banking system remain robust despite the global market and regional volatilities as exhibited by rising lending as well as deposit volumes.

Along with a solid growth in the fixed income book, the bank’s financing and sukuk portfolio reached AED 286 billion, up 7% beating year end guidance by 180 bps.

DIB earned significant improvements with several of its external ESG ratings, including from some of the top raters such as MSCI which has recently upgraded DIB to “A” from “BBB.” The Bank has been recognized for both making progress against its ESG strategy, and for enhancing disclosures and increasing transparency in our sustainability reporting.
